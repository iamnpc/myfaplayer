VLC-1.2.0-git is on the road!

Any questions please contact tewilove@gmail.com.

Build steps:
1. Edit local.properties to fit your environment.
2. Run build.sh. (for some reason, you have to install ruby-1.9.2 first.)

Currently you can only build the source with one ABI choice, armeabi or armeabi-v7a.
If you want to disable NEON version of ffmpeg, open jni/Application.mk and change APP_ABI to armeabi.
Cortex-A9 targets like XOOM do NOT have NEON, so you should set vfpv3 instead of neon to -mfpu.

NDK issues:
At least in NDK-r5b LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARY doesn't work. Please search google for solutions.
